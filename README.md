#### Description: 
<p>
This is a library management system called Tiny Library or TinyLib in short. The project is written in Python as the main programming language, using MySQL as database system, I also use HTML and CSS to design the web page. The system is designed for library staffs to manage the library. System main functions include adding new authors, categories, publishers, member and books, searching for books by title or members by their name, issuing books for members, and finally returing borrowed books back to the library.

The project is written using Django framework. The project includes some automatically created files through Django and some self-made files. The "manage.py" file is the main file to run the system. The "templates" folder contains all the HTML files for the web. The "static" folder contains the main CSS file and inside static, there is the "img" folder containing all the images used for this project. The "TinyLib" folder is the project folder. The "home" folder is where I created the functions and database for this project.
